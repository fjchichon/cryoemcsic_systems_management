# CryoEM-CSIC Facility Systems Management
## Information repository


### What is this repo?
This repository is devoted to the CryoEM-CSIC facility from CNB-CSIC in Madrid. It contains many useful pieces of information and might be used as a handbook for Facility operators. The different sections are self-contained but it is mainly separated into two:
- **The configuration files repository** - Mainly contains the raw files used to generate image schematics of the elements in the system, as well as Bash/Python scripts used for backups, data transfer, etc. AKA [This repo itself](https://github.com/fjchichon/cryoemcsic_systems_management).
- **The Facility Operator wiki** - A GitHub Wiki page set up for the curation of guides for Facility operation. That is to say, machine description, server installation and management, systems and network troubleshooting information pages, data transfer procedures... AKA [The Wiki](https://github.com/fjchichon/cryoemcsic_systems_management/wiki)

### Who is supposed to be using this information?
CryoEM-CSIC personnel. If you are not CryoEM-CSIC personnel, you might use it as an inspiration for your own CryoEM Facility, but probably this won't help you much as it is tailored for a specific scenario.
